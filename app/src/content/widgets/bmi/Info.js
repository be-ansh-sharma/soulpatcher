        <div className={styles.content}>
          The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and
          weight to work out if your weight is healthy. The BMI calculation
          divides an adult&APOS;s weight in kilograms by their height in metres
          squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.

          <div className={styles.content}>
            For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range. For
            children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation takes
            into account age and gender as well as height and weight. If your
            BMI is:
            <ul>
              <li>below 18.5 - you&APOS;re in the underweight range</li>
              <li>
                between 18.5 and 24.9 - you&APOS;re in the healthy weight range
              </li>
              <li>between 25 and 29.9 - you&APOS;re in the overweight range</li>
              <li>between 30 and 39.9 - you&APOS;re in the obese range</li>

              As well as measuring measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals
              may take other factors account when assessing if you&APOS;re a

              Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as
              heavyweight heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may

              Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health
              conditions. For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a
              higher risk of some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI
              of 23, which is usually considered healthy.

              You should not use BMI as a measure if you&APOS;re pregnant. Get
              advice from your midwife or GP if you&APOS;re concerned about your
              weight.
