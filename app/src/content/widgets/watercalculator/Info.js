            How Your Daily Water Needs are Calculated
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.content}>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Our Water Intake Calculator uses a simple formula to quickly
            estimate your fluid needs. Here’s how it works:
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Your general water requirements can be determined using your current
            body weight. Most people need to drink roughly half of their weight
            (in pounds) in ounces. For example, a 200-pound adult needs
            approximately 100 ounces of water each day.{' '}
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Of course, your water needs will increase with any physical
            activity. So you’ll need to add 12 ounces of water for every 30
            minutes of daily activity.{' '}
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            For example, a 200-pound adult who exercises for 45 minutes per day
            on average, will need roughly 168 ounces of water daily.
          </span>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li>150 ounces + (12 x 1.5) = 168 ounces</li>
          </ul>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Water needs can also fluctuate with the weather - you often need
            more fluids in hot and humid temperatures to reduce your risk of
            overheating.

            Why Drinking Water is Important
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.content}>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Water is essential for survival. It is needed to support nearly
            every single bodily function including sleep and digesting and
            metabolizing food. It also plays a role in regulating body
            temperature and allowing your muscles and organs to function
            properly.{' '}
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Water consumption can even support a healthy weight. Not only is
            water calorie-free, but drinking plenty of water, especially before
            meals, can help you decrease your calorie intake leading to weight
            loss.{' '}

            Where Does Eight Glasses a Day Come From?
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.content}>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            You might have heard the common advice telling you that we all need
            roughly eight glasses of water per day. This may seem like great
            common sense advice, but is it accurate?{' '}
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            The eight glasses a day rule comes from an influencer nutritionist
            by the name of Fredrick J. Stare. Although, this general guideline
            was never backed up by science and is still heavily debated to this
            day.
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            Eight glasses, or 64 ounces, of water daily might not be the right
            amount of water for everyone - general nutrition recommendations
            rarely work as a one-size-fits-all approach.{' '}
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            According to the National Academy of Science (NAS) and National
            Academy of Medicine (NAM), the recommended guideline for adults is
            125 ounces for men and 91 ounces for women.
          </span>
          <span className={styles.para}>
            However, some of this (~20%) can come from food intake, so the
            adjusted recommendation is closer to 100 ounces for men and 75
            ounces for women - both of which are higher than the eight glasses a
            day!
